**It will not currently read the data from the _Crew Roster_ interface**

To get started, simply put your mouse over a crew member and press the Alt + 1 key combination. The reader will find the data on the screen and automatically fill it in the corresponding box on the plugin interface.

Once you have entered your crew, go to the Voyage List and select you voyage you want to calculate and press Alt + 1. The reader will automatically fill your required voyage targets on the plugin interface.
